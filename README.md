### Elevator Pitch

**Linguamaps** is a revolutionary web application that transforms the way we learn languages by using _AI_ to deliver a <u> personalized, immersive, and cost-effective learning experience</u>.<br>By integrating real-world scenarios with interactive exercises on a _Google Maps_ Street View interface, **Linguamaps** offers users a practical approach to mastering new languages by taking advantage of the knowledge the user has of their native language.<br> Language learning is not <u>equal</u>. **Lingumaps** takes into account the advantages and disadvantages of the learner based on their background. It offers a realistic long term language `practice for anyone in any level`.

### Technologies overview: _`Linguamaps`_

At this project, we will be utilizing the following technologies:<br><br>
| Feature | Description |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **HTML** | Uses correct HTML structure for the application, with pages for login, main interface, and progress tracking. |
| **CSS** | Styling for responsive design, good use of whitespace, and consistent color schemes across devices. |
| **JavaScript** | Handles user interactions, such as selecting languages, navigating through exercises, and rendering feedback. |
| **React** | Utilizes React for building a single-page application with component-based structure, routing, and state management.|
| **Service** | Backend service with endpoints for:<br> - `login`: Handles user authentication and session management.<br> - `retrieveExercises`: Fetches personalized language exercises.<br> - `submitProgress`: Submits user progress for tracking and feedback.|
| **Third-Party Service** | Integration with Google Maps API for Street View and OpenAI API for generating dialogue prompts. |
| **DB/Login** | Uses a secure database to store user profiles, progress data, and credentials. Ensures that users are authenticated before accessing learning features. |
| **WebSocket** | Enables real-time updates and interactions, such as immediate feedback on exercises and collaborative practice with other users. |

### Additional Features (Ideas)
#### Authentication
- **User Accounts:** Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. Secure authentication will be implemented to ensure data privacy.
- **Display:** Upon login, the user's name will be displayed on the interface, along with personalized learning paths.

#### Database
- **Persistent Data Storage:** User progress, preferences, and account details will be stored in a secure database, ensuring data integrity and availability across sessions.
- **User Data:** Manage user-specific data such as progress reports and personalized learning content.

#### WebSocket
- **Real-Time Data Exchange:** WebSockets will enable real-time updates, such as live feedback on exercises and interactive elements between users (e.g., practicing dialogue with peers).
- **Use Cases:** Real-time notifications and updates on other users' progress in collaborative learning environments.
