### Technologies overview:  *`Linguamaps`*
At this project, we will be utilizing the following technologies:<br><br>
| Feature                  | Description                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **HTML**                 | Uses correct HTML structure for the application, with pages for login, main interface, and progress tracking.     |
| **CSS**                  | Styling for responsive design, good use of whitespace, and consistent color schemes across devices.                |
| **JavaScript**           | Handles user interactions, such as selecting languages, navigating through exercises, and rendering feedback.      |
| **React**                | Utilizes React for building a single-page application with component-based structure, routing, and state management.|
| **Service**              | Backend service with endpoints for:<br> - `login`: Handles user authentication and session management.<br> - `retrieveExercises`: Fetches personalized language exercises.<br> - `submitProgress`: Submits user progress for tracking and feedback.|
| **Third-Party Service**  | Integration with Google Maps API for Street View and OpenAI API for generating dialogue prompts.                   |
| **DB/Login**             | Uses a secure database to store user profiles, progress data, and credentials. Ensures that users are authenticated before accessing learning features. |
| **WebSocket**            | Enables real-time updates and interactions, such as immediate feedback on exercises and collaborative practice with other users. |
