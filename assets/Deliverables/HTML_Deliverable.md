# HTML Deliverable

## Overview
For this deliverable, the structure of the application was built using HTML to ensure proper layout and navigation across the different sections of the application.

## Key Components
- **HTML Pages**: Created three separate HTML pages for the login, main interface, and progress reports to structure the user journey.
- **Links**: Added navigation links between the login, main interface, and progress report pages to facilitate easy navigation for users.
- **Text Elements**: Incorporated text for instructions, dialogue prompts, and feedback to guide users through the application.
- **Images**: Integrated Google Maps Street View to provide immersive learning scenarios, enhancing the interactive experience.
- **DB/Login**: Developed input fields and buttons for user registration and login functionalities, allowing users to create and access their accounts.
- **WebSocket**: Implemented WebSocket to display real-time updates of user progress and feedback within the HTML structure.

## Process
1. **Page Creation**: Set up individual HTML files for each major part of the application.
2. **Navigation**: Used anchor tags to link between pages, providing smooth transitions.
3. **Content Placement**: Arranged text and images logically to ensure a user-friendly interface.
