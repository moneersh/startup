# React Deliverable

## Overview
This deliverable involved using JavaScript and React to build the application's frontend, implementing functionality for a single user, and setting placeholders for future features.

## Key Components
- **Bundled and Transpiled**: Completed using Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the React application.
- **Components**: Created components for login, language selection, exercise display, and feedback to modularize the application.
- **Login**: Managed transitions to the main learning interface upon successful login using state management.
- **Database Integration**: Displayed user progress from local storage as a placeholder, with plans to integrate MongoDB.
- **WebSocket Simulation**: Used `setInterval` to simulate real-time feedback, mimicking future WebSocket functionality.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Application logic dynamically updates exercise content based on user selections and performance.
- **Router**: Implemented React Router for navigation between the login, main interface, and progress report components.
- **Hooks**: Utilized React hooks for managing state within functional components.

## Process
1. **Setup**: Configured the React environment with Webpack and Babel.
2. **Component Creation**: Built reusable components for various sections of the app.
3. **State Management**: Employed hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for state and lifecycle management.
4. **Routing**: Set up React Router to manage in-app navigation.
5. **Simulating Real-Time Updates**: Used JavaScript intervals to simulate WebSocket updates until the backend is fully integrated.
